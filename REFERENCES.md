### Abstract Template:

> Governance and public policy decision-making require a balance of ethics, statecraft, long-term planning, and data-driven reasoning. While modern AI systems offer computational power, they often lack cultural grounding and explainability. This paper presents a novel neuro-symbolic decision intelligence framework that integrates Chanakya's Arthashastra—a 2300-year-old treatise on governance—with contemporary AI techniques. Our system employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to match policy problems with relevant Chanakyan doctrines, followed by Large Language Model (LLM) inference for structured recommendations. We implement Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for quantitative policy evaluation across five dimensions: welfare, economic viability, law and order, political stability, and implementation feasibility. Evaluation on four real-world governance scenarios demonstrates 100% accuracy in doctrine retrieval and produces actionable, explainable policy recommendations grounded in traditional strategic principles. This work contributes: (1) the first structured digital corpus of Arthashastra for AI systems, (2) a practical hybrid architecture for knowledge-integrated AI, (3) a transparent decision support system applicable to agriculture, healthcare, and crisis management, and (4) a methodology for cultural adaptation of AI systems. Our findings suggest that traditional knowledge systems can significantly enhance modern AI, providing both technical improvements and cultural legitimacy.
